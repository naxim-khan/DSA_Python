Node: 
A node is a fundamental building block that contains two main components:
Data: This is the actual information or value that the node holds.
Pointer/Reference: This is a reference to te next node in the sequence.
(in the case of link list) or to the child nodes (in the case of a tree).
Example:
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next_node = None

In this example, the Node class has a constructor 
(__init__) that takes the data as a parameter and 
initializes the next_node to None. This allows you 
to create a linked list by connecting nodes together
through their next_node references.
